									Integrating an array of time-of-flight 3D cameras, the
									algorithm uses coordinate transformations to convert the point
									clouds provided by each camera into a main one, creating a
									360Â° snapshot of the environment within a six-meter radius.
									The challenge is to develop an algorithm fast enough to
									provide collision avoidance decisions in real time.

									Multicopters have a wide range of applications from
									surveillance to package delivery and medical support. Although
									growing in popularity, they are not used yet on an industrial
									scale for safety reasons. The goal of Safecopter is to develop
									a modular collision detection and avoidance system that would
									make flying a multicopter in autonomous or tele-operated mode
									completely safe and responsive to the changing environment.

									Based on the research of multiple collision detection
									algorithms, the octree spatial partitioning system proved to
									be the most efficient. In comparison to the point cloud based
									algorithm, it was more than 320 times faster. Developed in
									C++, the algorithm was able to achieve this level of
									performance by organizing the data into tree-like hierarchies
									and performing binary operations.

									A key element of developing an advanced collision avoidance
									algorithm is the ability to simulate complex indoor and
									outdoor environments. Safecopter was modeled in 3D and, using
									the Gazebo physics simulator, different scenarios were tested,
									without running the risk of causing an expensive crash.
